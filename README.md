'Learn with easy' is a website in which you can create and share flashcards that will help you study more easily. After creating flashcards you can select them and start studying, they will display in random order with the setting you choose(NOT implemented yet) or you can make a post and share them with other people.

BEFORE RUNNING THE PROJECT: make sure you install all of th requirements, go to setting.py and adjust the database setting to your liking.
